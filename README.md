    - Plan:
      - Multithread vs SingleThread (( one thread === one callstack === one thing at a time ))
      - Download [this video](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ)
      - Working with Modules ( edge cases )
      - An Example of Sync vs Async
      - the syntax of the three standard built in modules
      - the Point of npm, npm scripts
    - Idea:
      - Maybe create a separate Node.js PDF and dub it as smth that gives an overview to get the concept 
      behind the documentation and the snippets plus if any intricacies make sense to be added as `pdf` put 
      them into the sort of appendix :)
